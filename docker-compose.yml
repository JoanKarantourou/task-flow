# Docker Compose configuration for TaskFlow development environment
# This file defines all the services (containers) needed to run the application locally

version: '3.8'

services:
  # PostgreSQL Database Service
  # This is our primary database where all TaskFlow data will be stored
  postgres:
    # Use PostgreSQL version 16 (latest stable version)
    image: postgres:16
    
    # Container name for easy reference
    container_name: taskflow-postgres
    
    # Environment variables to configure PostgreSQL

    # Port mapping: host_port:container_port
    # Maps port 5432 on your machine to port 5432 in the container
    # This allows your .NET app to connect to localhost:5432
    ports:

    # Without this, all data would be lost when the container stops
